Motivation:
I was motivated to explore how the pandemic has influenced global economies. This analysis not only enhanced my analytical skills but also contribute to the broader understanding of economic resilience and recovery in the face of unprecedented crisis of the century.
This pandemic has reshaped the global economic landscape and many aspects of daily life. 
As a data analyst with a strong interest in macroeconomic trends and policymaking, I’m always striving to gain a better understanding of various economic indicators and their trajectories.
Questions:
1. How did GDP growth rates change worldwide and in different countries before, during and after the pandemic?
2. What were the trends in unemployment rates before, during, and after the pandemic?
3. What changes occurred to the Human Development Index?
4. What trends are observed in the Human Freedom Index?
Challenges:
The primary challenge was scrubbing data reports to ensure they were clean and ready for analysis and visualization. Python played a crucial role in this stage, enabling the cleaning, processing, and calculations. Additionally, Python was instrumental in constructing long datasets suitable for comprehensive use in Tableau. This step was essential for building global maps and presenting each index effectively as part of the dashboards. 
Technologies used:
1.	Python
2.	Tableau
3.	PowerPoint
4.	Git

Conclusion: 
My observations have shown that while the economy is a significant aspect of our daily lives, its impact on overall quality of life and well-being is relatively minor compared to the influence of social events and political developments.
Indexes like HDI and HFI provide a strong reflection of our standing as a global community. Unfortunately, recent trends reveal declines and slow progression, meaning we have some ‘catching up’ to do. 
I will look forward to revisiting this project in the future as more updated data becomes available, with the hope that we will see signs of recovery, which will happen in the coming years.
